# Korona Pirkanmaalla

The local university hospital reports the number of daily new cases of COVID-19 in the region, but their website didn't have a graphical representation of the data. So I quickly made one myself using Chart.js. (They have since added a graph to the hospital's site.)

I used a netlify lambda to scrape the numbers from the website, in order to get around CORS restrictions.
